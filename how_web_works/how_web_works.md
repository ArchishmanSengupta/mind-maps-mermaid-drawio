- **Theory Importance:**
  - While not immediately crucial, understanding becomes increasingly beneficial over time as you delve deeper into web development.

- **Clients and Servers:**
  - Clients:
    - Devices connected to the internet.
    - Examples: Personal computers, smartphones.
    - Utilize web browsers like Firefox or Chrome.
  - Servers:
    - Store and distribute web content.
    - Fulfill client requests by providing webpage data.

- **Other Components:**
  - Internet Connection:
    - Medium for data transmission.
  - TCP/IP:
    - Protocols governing internet communication.
  - DNS:
    - Translates human-readable web addresses to IP addresses.
  - HTTP:
    - Facilitates communication between clients and servers.
  - Component Files:
    - Code Files:
      - HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
    - Assets:
      - Images, videos, documents.

- **Webpage Retrieval Process:**
  - Browser initiates DNS lookup to resolve web address to IP.
  - HTTP request sent from client to server.
  - Server responds with webpage data packets.
  - Browser assembles and displays webpage content.

- **Order of Component File Parsing:**
  - HTML parsed first to construct DOM.
  - External CSS/JavaScript files fetched and parsed subsequently.
  - DOM and CSSOM structures built.
  - Page rendering begins, applying styles and executing scripts.

- **DNS Explanation:**
  - Web addresses mapped to unique IP addresses.
  - DNS resolves addresses to corresponding IPs.
  - DNS lookup tools facilitate IP retrieval.

- **Explanation of Packets:**
  - Data transmitted in small packets.
  - Advantages:
    - Redundancy guards against packet loss.
    - Facilitates efficient routing and simultaneous user access.
